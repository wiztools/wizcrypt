      <answer>

      <question>Can I decrypt a file I encrypted using a older version of WizCrypt?</question>
      <answer>
        <p>
	No. The pre-3.x version file formats were not designed for reliability. Version 3.0 onwards we support
        backward compatibility (that is, any version above 3.x will support backward compatibility till version 3.0).
