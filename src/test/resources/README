The logo.png Test
=================

The `logo.png test' is for testing the compatibility of
later versions of WizCrypt with the first ever released
version. What is in this directory have been created using
the version 1 of WizCrypt. The test should generate these
files using the new version of WizCrypt and then compute md5 
and try to match them with what is available here.
